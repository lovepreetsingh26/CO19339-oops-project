# **REPORT ON OOPS PROJECT**

**A brief Introduction:**

**Our College Management System works on a global level and can be used for keeping track of almost every college globally. Although, it was a mini project, on a higher level it can be used by a globally recognized institute for education like UNESCO for maintaining the statistics of educational institutes around the world.**

**AIM:**

**To build a College Management System which performs several functions such as adding a new professor or student in the database, fetch their details by various methods like professors with same name, same role, same college, by subjects, and students with same batch, branch and college or even remove them.**

**Used Header Files**

**1) iostream – Stands for input-output stream. This class contains definitions for various functions like cin, cout, many functions which are defined in other classes like vector but declared in this.**

**2) string – This class is a part of STL and based on strings and makes it easier for the programmer to work with strings as it contains a lot of functions.**

**3) vector – This one is also a part of STL and based on dynamic arrays. It also contains a lot of functions which makes it easier for the programmer to work with arrays.**

**4) algorithm – It contains definitions of several functions.**

**IDE used:**

**We used Visual Studio Code as the IDE and the file containing source code has been uploaded separately.**
